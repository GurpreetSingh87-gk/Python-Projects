## 1. 📠 Calculator App 

The Calculator app is GUI (Graphical User Interface) Tkinter based calculator that includes arithmetic calculations.

## Features

The Calculator app code is divided into two parts first contains functionality of calculations and second design of whole caculator. 

**Functionality of Calculations :-** I have created separate sections that deals with different parts of calculator app such as:

  - **Input Function :** It takes inputs that user put numbers to calculate them.
  
  - **Clear Input Function :** It removes all calculations that were entered as input.
  
  - **Cut Input Function :** Just like a mobile calculator, the cut button deletes numbers one by one as per the user's wish.
  
  - **CE Input Function :** CE button turns every calculation as zero.

  - **Function to Calculate Result :** This functions shows the result of calculations. If user puts right input then calculator will insert or delete input. If user puts       wrong inputs then calculator will show error.  

**Design of Calculator :-** It contains functions that designs the whole calculator such as button's size, entry input etc.

  - **Main Window :** I have imported Tkinter (Python Library) to build GUI (Graphical User Interface) Window.
